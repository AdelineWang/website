<p> Job Hunt </p>
 <p> At the University of Waterloo, we start applying for jobs as early as after a single semester of formal instruction. Needless to say, this is a little intimidating for the first-years with minimal formal work experience and are still in the midst of adjusting to university life. </p>

 <p> 

 The first step I would say would be to attend a few "Employer Info Sessions" at Waterloo. I've attended some by Google, McKinssey, IBM to name a few. There I learnt more about the job, a better idea of the work environment, and the type of candidates and skills required for the job. After going to a few sessions, I was able to formulate a pattern and a common theme emphathized by all employers. Employers are well aware that we are students and are still learning. However, if one has demonstrated the raw attributes in the past, that would help them succeed in the workplace, that would be a major asset for the candidate and a positive indication that they will do well in the job. 
</p>

<p>
In the first round, where all students are competing with one another, students can apply to a maximum of 50 jobs. In a pool of 750+ jobs for ECE students avilable, students must strategically chose which jobs they would be the best fit for. I added jobs in my "Short List" (a list of selected jobs by the student to apply for) based on 3 criteria. </P>

 a) Jobs I believe I am capable of doing with ease. For a typical 1A student, that would be either QA Testing or an entry level software developer. </li>

b) Jobs I have some requirements for. Eg: junioe software developer. 
	
 c) Jobs I would like to do in the future. Eg. management consulting, senior-level software engineer in larger American companies. 
	



<p>
	Now, from my list of various level jobs in my shortlist. I usually have around 30 jobs in each of my 3 categories. I then limit that list down to a few QA jobs, mostly junior software development jobs (30), and a few senior jobs (10). I can see the scope of all my applications now more easily. <p>

		My name is Adeline Wang, an electrical engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

		<p>
			Reasons why I chose University of Waterloo? </p>

		<p>
		1. Like most of my classmates, Waterloo's internationally recognized coop program was one the main factors. We alternate between school and work every 4 months, leaving students with 2 years of relevent work experience before graduation. This allows one to explore different types of companies (start-up vs large coorporations), roles (technical vs management, software vs hardware), and industried (consulting vs manufacturing). Consequently, upon graduation, students have a better idea of their professional goals. </p>

		<p>
		2. Waterloo is one of the most innovative institutions in Canada. I love that we are given opportunities to start out projects through Velocity and a network of support. Waterloo does not own students' inventions, and allows students to patent under their own name, unlike most universities. </p>

		<p>
		3. Waterloo has an exceptional strong network of support in engineering. Waterloo consistantly hosts Hackathons, student seminars (AutoCAD, Python, Excel workshops), ample opportunities for student design teams, and leadership and volunteer positions available all over campus.  </p>

		<p>
		Coming from Edmonton, university was one of my first opportunities to live completely independently from my family. I have lived in a group in summer programs such as Shad Valley, so living in residence wasn't a complete shock to me. I chose to move away from home for several reasons.</p>
		<p>
		1. I wanted to gain independence and mature more. Moving away forced me to regulate my time, diet, sleep schedule, and overall freedom completely on my own. 
		<p>
		</p>
				2. I wanted to meet new diverse group of friends. While there were a lot of students in my class from Toronto, over half were from the rest of Canada and the world. 
		
		<p>
		</p>
		3. Living on residence first-year is an immediate source of friends, and has been one of my best experiences so far. My floormates are some of my closest friends and study partners. 
	<p>
		</p>
		4. I was exposed to different ways of living, outside my own bubble and lifestyle developed by my parents. I became more customed to different cultures, lifestyles, people.
