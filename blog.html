		My name is Adeline Wang, an electrical engineering student at the University of Waterloo. 
	</p>

		
		<p>
			Reasons why I chose University of Waterloo? </p>

		<p>
		1. Like most of my classmates, Waterloo's internationally recognized coop program was one the main factors. We alternate between school and work every 4 months, leaving students with 2 years of relevent work experience before graduation. This allows one to explore different types of companies (start-up vs large coorporations), roles (technical vs management, software vs hardware), and industried (consulting vs manufacturing). Consequently, upon graduation, students have a better idea of their professional goals. </p>

		<p>
		2. Waterloo is one of the most innovative institutions in Canada. I love that we are given opportunities to start out projects through Velocity and a network of support. Waterloo does not own students' inventions, and allows students to patent under their own name, unlike most universities. </p>

		<p>
		3. Waterloo has an exceptional strong network of support in engineering. Waterloo consistantly hosts Hackathons, student seminars (AutoCAD, Python, Excel workshops), ample opportunities for student design teams, and leadership and volunteer positions available all over campus.  </p>

		<p>
		Coming from Edmonton, university was one of my first opportunities to live completely independently from my family. I have lived in a group in summer programs such as Shad Valley, so living in residence wasn't a complete shock to me. I chose to move away from home for several reasons.</p>
		<p>
		1. I wanted to gain independence and mature more. Moving away forced me to regulate my time, diet, sleep schedule, and overall freedom completely on my own. 
		<p>
		</p>
				2. I wanted to meet new diverse group of friends. While there were a lot of students in my class from Toronto, over half were from the rest of Canada and the world. 
		
		<p>
		</p>
		3. Living on residence first-year is an immediate source of friends, and has been one of my best experiences so far. My floormates are some of my closest friends and study partners. 
	<p>
		</p>
		4. I was exposed to different ways of living, outside my own bubble and lifestyle developed by my parents. I became more customed to different cultures, lifestyles, people.
