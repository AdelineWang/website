<p> Job Hunt </p>
 <p> At the University of Waterloo, we start applying for jobs as early as after a single semester of formal instruction. Needless to say, this is a little intimidating for the first-years with minimal formal work experience and are still in the midst of adjusting to university life. </p>

 <p> 

 The first step I would say would be to attend a few "Employer Info Sessions" at Waterloo. I've attended some by Google, McKinssey, IBM to name a few. There I learnt more about the job, a better idea of the work environment, and the type of candidates and skills required for the job. After going to a few sessions, I was able to formulate a pattern and a common theme emphathized by all employers. Employers are well aware that we are students and are still learning. However, if one has demonstrated the raw attributes in the past, that would help them succeed in the workplace, that would be a major asset for the candidate and a positive indication that they will do well in the job. 
</p>

<p>
In the first round, where all students are competing with one another, students can apply to a maximum of 50 jobs. In a pool of 750+ jobs for ECE students avilable, students must strategically chose which jobs they would be the best fit for. I added jobs in my "Short List" (a list of selected jobs by the student to apply for) based on 3 criteria. </P>

I categorized jobs into 3 sections. Ones that I believe I can do comfortablely (QA testing), jobs that I have most of the qualifications for (junior software development) and jobs that I was interested in, but unqualified for now (senior developer, management consulting) </p>



<p>
	Now, from my list of various level jobs in my shortlist. I usually have around 30 jobs in each of my 3 categories. I then limit that list down to a few QA jobs, mostly junior software development jobs (30), and a few senior jobs (10). I can see the scope of all my applications now more easily. <p>

			Reasons why I chose University of Waterloo? </p>

		<p>
		1. Like most of my classmates, Waterloo's internationally recognized coop program was one the main factors. We alternate between school and work every 4 months, leaving students with 2 years of relevent work experience before graduation. This allows one to explore different types of companies (start-up vs large coorporations), roles (technical vs management, software vs hardware), and industried (consulting vs manufacturing). Consequently, upon graduation, students have a better idea of their professional goals. </p>

		<p>
		2. Waterloo is one of the most innovative institutions in Canada. I love that we are given opportunities to start out projects through Velocity and a network of support. Waterloo does not own students' inventions, and allows students to patent under their own name, unlike most universities. </p>

		<p>
		3. Waterloo has an exceptional strong network of support in engineering. Waterloo consistantly hosts Hackathons, student seminars (AutoCAD, Python, Excel workshops), ample opportunities for student design teams, and leadership and volunteer positions available all over campus.  </p>
