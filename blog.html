      <p class="date">5 April, 2016</p>
      <p class="text">As I finished my first term of electrical engineering at the University of Waterloo. Here are some of my thoughts to share and some information about each of my courses, as well as some study tips. 

<br />
<br />

Having done International Baccalaureate program in high school, I expected to feel well adjusted to the engineering workload at Waterloo. Boy was I wrong... Overall I found the difficulty of 1A alright, but had trouble adjusting to the workload and time-management. 

<br />
<br />
Let’s talk courses: 


<br />
<br />

ECE 150 (Introduction to Programming): This is an intro programming classes, designed for students with no prior programming experience. The people with no experience really struggled, but this was a bird course for students who have taken programming in high school. I had some experience in programming before, and found this course very easy up to midterms, and spent more time after midterms. We learnt types, loops, and arrays up to the midterm; object-oriented concepts, linked lists, file-reading were introduced afterwards. The midterm and final were based off assignments and class lectures, so this course was directly proportional to one’s work ethic. We had labs and tutorials with on-demand help from TAs to complete assignments, as well as extra help sessions. I studied by going over my assignments and making sure I really understood them. I didn’t review lectures every single lecture, but ensured I understood all the concepts as they were introduced in class. I studied for the midterm and final by reviewing assignments, and completing all the review problems my prof gave, which was similar to parts of the exam. All these support systems made the course very enjoyable, and this was an excellent and comfortable introduction to computer science.

ECE 140 (Linear Circuits): This class introduces various techniques to solve circuits and op amps, such as modal and mesh analysis, superposition, Thevenin and Norton in both AC and DC frequencies. This course may sound intimidating at first, but it was one of my highest marks. Practice and repetition is key to success in this class in particular. In addition, the professor is important. I had a great prof who explained concepts in a clear and systematic manner. Like ECE 150, I really tried to understand all concepts, and did my assignments, albeit optional. The final exam was harder compared to previous years, but still very doable. I think this course solidified by desire to study Electrical Engineering.

ECE 105 (Physics): By far the notoriously difficult ECE 105 gave myself and my classmates the most stress in ECE. The professors seemed to simplify the course from previous years. I studied by redoing all the problems my professor went over in class and my quizzes. I was not able to solve the questions alone, but I replicated the thought-process my prof and classmates had and managed an average mark. 105 was my lowest mark, but highest in terms of effort. Though I learnt all the concepts in high school, the difficulty of application of the theory was significantly more challenging. This is a mechanics course- covering kinematics, oscillation, statics, and rotational motion.  


<br />
<br />

Math 117 (Calculus): Having done IB math in high school, I learnt most of the concepts in high school. The level of understanding and application this course requires is a lot more in this course. I did a lot of practice problems, past exams, and assignments. The problems that my prof introduced in class is easier compared to assignments or exams.  This course covered precalculus (Grade 11 math), calculus which include: limits, derivatives, curve sketching, integrals, and complex numbers. Note that it is imperative to do well on the final exam, as it has the highest weighting of all subjects at 65%.

<br />
<br />


Chem 102 (General Chemistry): Like Calculus, this course has a high final exam weighting. The exams are in the form of multiple choice, due to the magnitude of students taking the course. We learnt stoichiometry, gases, phase solutions, electrochemistry, kinetics, and equilibrium. I would say that I learnt 90% of the material in high school. However, I was not familiar with the type of problems; they were mostly calculation problems, each taking around 15 minutes to complete. Though with regularly reviewing problems, going to extra help sessions, and studying with friends, this course gave me the least stress and was one of my highest marks. The fact that chem is usually the last exam makes it hard to properly manage time and energy for the duration of exam week. I compensated by studying for chem extra early and doing past exams way before any other course.
